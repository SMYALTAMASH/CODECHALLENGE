# CHALLENGE 1: A 3-tier environment is a common setup. Use a tool of your choosing/familiarity create these resources on a cloud environment (Azure/AWS/GCP). Please remember we will not be judged on the outcome but more focusing on the approach, style and reproducibility.

* As the question is too open and there is no restriction to cloud/tool/framework, i would like to take this oppurtunity to take something unique which is a serverless framework to play with.
